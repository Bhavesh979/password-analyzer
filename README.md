# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

🚀 **Project built for the Google Tools Hackathon**

Password Strength Analyzer is a cybersecurity web application that analyzes password security and helps users create stronger passwords. The system checks common password security rules and classifies passwords as **Weak, Moderate, or Strong**.

The tool also generates secure passwords and stores password analysis data using **Firebase Firestore** for security analytics.
